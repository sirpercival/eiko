Installation &c.

1) Run ./phenny - this creates a default config file
2) Edit ~/.phenny/default.py
3) Run ./phenny - this now runs phenny with your settings

Enjoy!

Note from sirp: the translate module doesn't really work... I tend to disable it. Also some things are buggy, particularly the dialect stuff....
